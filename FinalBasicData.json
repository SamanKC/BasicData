                    "answer": "Two-step authentication (also known as two-factor authentication or 2FA) is an additional layer of security that helps protect your accounts from unauthorized access. It requires you to provide two different authentication factors when logging in to your account. The first factor is typically something you know, such as a password. The second factor is typically something you have, such as a mobile phone or a security token. Two-step authentication helps prevent unauthorized access to your accounts by requiring an attacker to have both your password and access to your phone or security token in order to log in. This makes it much more difficult for them to gain access to your account, even if they manage to obtain your password through malicious means such as phishing or a data breach. For Example, If you set up 2FA for your Facebook account, you would enter your password as first authentication factor and then a code that you receive via text message or SMS on your smartphone as your second authentication factor. After you enter this code your login process will be complete.",

                    "answer": "Password Manager is a tool that helps you to store and manage your password online in a secure way. Instead of having to remember many different passwords for all of your online accounts, you can use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords for each account. You can then access all of your passwords using a single master password or a secure authentication method such as biometric authentication. It helps you to improve your online security by making it easier to use strong, unique password for each of your accounts. This reduces the risk of password reuse, which could have made it easier for hackers to gain access to your accounts if one of your passwords is compromised. Password managers can also help you keep track of your passwords and log in to your accounts more quickly and easily. Some password managers also have additional features, such as the ability to store and manage other types of sensitive information, such as credit card numbers and security questions, and to automatically fill in login forms on websites. So, it's important to choose reputable password manager and to use a strong, unique master password to protect your accounts and sensitive information. You should also make sure to keep your password manager up to date and to use two-factor authentication if it is available.",

                    "answer": "Encryption is a process of protecting information or message or data by covering into a code in such a way that it can only be access by the authorized parties or with the right decryption key. It is used to secure communication, data storage, and other types of sensitive information. The key is a secret code that is used to encrypt and decrypt the message. Without the key, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to decrypt the message and read its contents. There are many different types of encryption algorithms and keys, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. The security of an encrypted message depends on the strength of the algorithm and the length and complexity of the key. In general, the longer and more complex the key, the more secure the encryption will be. Encryption is used to protect information from being accessed by unauthorized parties. For example, when you send an email, the message is encrypted while it is being transmitted over the internet to prevent anyone from intercepting and reading it. Encryption is also used to secure data stored on computers and other devices, such as smartphones and tablets. It helps to protect sensitive information from unauthorized parties and can prevent data from cyber attacks.",
